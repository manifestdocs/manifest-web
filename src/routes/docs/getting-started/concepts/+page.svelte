<h1>Concepts</h1>

<p>Understanding Manifest's data model.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    Manifest tracks features over the long term as living documentation rather than ephemeral tasks.
    Features form a tree that mirrors your product's architecture, and AI agents use it to understand
    what to build and to record what they've done.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
    A feature describes what your system does. Most features are user-facing (Password Reset, OAuth Login, Webhooks),
    but non-product features work too (Quality Documentation, Code Coverage, Quick Rollback).
</p>

<p>
    AI coding agents are good at breaking down features into tasks and organizing their own sub-agents for implementation.
    You define the feature, they figure out the steps.
</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Features</th>
            <th>Tasks</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Password Reset</td>
            <td>Refactor Auth</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Code Coverage</td>
            <td>Code Review</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Quick Rollback</td>
            <td>Sprint 12 Planning</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Feature details can be anything, but we recommend:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>User story:</strong> Clarifies who benefits and why, helping agents understand intent</li>
    <li><strong>Acceptance criteria:</strong> Defines "done" for both humans reviewing and agents implementing</li>
    <li><strong>Technical notes:</strong> Constraints and context that prevent agents from making wrong assumptions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feature tree</h2>

<p>Features form a hierarchy mirroring your product's architecture:</p>

<CodeBlock code={`MyProject
├── ● Authentication
│   ├── ● Password Login
│   ├── ○ OAuth Integration
│   └── ◇ Two-Factor Auth
└── ◇ Webhooks`} />

<p>Leaf features can be implemented directly. Parent features with children are called <strong>chapters</strong>.</p>

<h2>Chapters</h2>

<p>Chapters are features that contain other features. They organize related functionality into logical groups:</p>

<CodeBlock code={`◇ Authentication          ← Chapter (has children)
├── ◇ Password Login      ← Leaf feature
├── ◇ OAuth Integration   ← Leaf feature
└── ◇ Two-Factor Auth     ← Leaf feature`} />

<p>Use chapters to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Group related features (e.g., all auth features under "Authentication")</li>
    <li>Mirror your codebase architecture</li>
    <li>Create navigation hierarchy in the feature tree</li>
</ul>

<p>Chapters can be nested. A chapter's state reflects its children—it's complete when all children are implemented.</p>

<h2>Feature states</h2>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>State</th>
            <th>Symbol</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Proposed</td>
            <td>◇</td>
            <td>Idea in the backlog</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>In progress</td>
            <td>○</td>
            <td>Currently being worked on</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Implemented</td>
            <td>●</td>
            <td>Complete and documented</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Archived</td>
            <td>✗</td>
            <td>Soft-deleted, can be restored</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Archiving and deleting</h2>

<p>Manifest uses a two-step deletion flow to prevent accidents:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Archive:</strong> Soft-deletes the feature. Archived features are hidden from normal views but can be restored.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete permanently:</strong> Removes the feature from the database entirely. This cannot be undone.</li>
</ol>

<p>To delete a feature, first archive it, then delete it. This gives you a chance to recover if you archive something by mistake.</p>

<h2>Feature history</h2>

<p>
    Every feature has an append-only history log (like <code>git log</code> for your product).
    When an agent completes work, it records a summary and links to commits.
</p>

<h2>Versions</h2>

<p>
    Versions group features into release milestones. Manifest organizes versions into Now (current focus),
    Next (queued up), and Later (backlog).
</p>
